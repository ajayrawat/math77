\begapp A Files Required by Each Entry

{\normalsize The following tabulation shows for each user-callable procedure
name in the MATH77 library the set of program files needed to support the use
of that procedure name. A program file contains one or more Fortran program
units. A program unit contains the code for one or more procedures (more
than one if ENTRY statements are present).  Files are listed in lower
case, entries in upper case.  If an entry uses an entry that is
not in a MATH77 file, it is listed with the files, but in upper case.}

{\normalsize The term ``file" is used here as it is used in most operating
systems. For the UNISYS (UNIVAC) system replace the term ``file" with
``element."}\vspace{5pt}
